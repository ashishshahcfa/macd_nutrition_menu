**MacDonalds Nutrition Analysis**

This SQL project explores and analyzes McDonald's menu items with a focus on nutritional content. The analysis covers a range of insights, such as identifying high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sodium items, as well as comparing nutrient averages across food categories. 

Various SQL techniques are used, including:

**Data Exploration**: Viewing and filtering distinct items and categories.
**Aggregation Functions**: Calculating averages, maximum, and minimum values for nutrients like calories, fat, protein, sugar, cholesterol, and sodium.
**Window Functions**: Performing ranking operations and statistical calculations such as variance and standard deviation by category.
**Conditional Filtering**: Identifying items based on specific nutrient thresholds (e.g., items with zero sugar, high saturated fat, or low cholesterol).
**Advanced Calculations**: Calculating percentages (e.g., fat-to-calorie ratio) and determining "healthiest" items based on multiple nutritional factors.
